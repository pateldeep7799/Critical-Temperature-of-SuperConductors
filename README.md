# Critical-Temperature-of-SuperConductors
A superconductor is an important material used in many practical applications. Depending on their critical temperature they are used for various applications. We used different machine learning regression and classification techniques to determine the critical temperature and its level of superconductivity. Regression is used to predict 𝑻𝒄 (Critical Temperature ) and classification to predict the level of superconductivity (Low or high).The models used here are Decision Tree, Linear regression, Support vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting, bagging.   Keywords—Superconductivity, Critical Temperature, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Support vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).
